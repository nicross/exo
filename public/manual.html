        <h2>Welcome to <span class="redacted">redacted</span></h2>
        <p>You stand solid in your E.X.O., an experimental military exosuit designed for exploring extraterrestrial terrain. Moments before, you touched down on an icy exomoon in the periphery of <span class="redacted">redacted</span> space. Your mission is to scout and collect the materials for a forward base.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>System Requirements</h2>
        <p>E.X.O. is best experienced with headphones and a gamepad.</p>
        <p>Real-time synthesis is an <em>extremely</em> CPU-intensive process. E.X.O. will attempt to run on any machine that meets its minimum requirements; however, pilots may experience stuttering or drop-outs when running below the recommended requirements.</p>

        <h3>Minimum System Requirements</h3>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>CPU</th>
            <td>SSE2 capable (64-bit)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>RAM</th>
            <td>2 GB</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Recommended System Requirements</h3>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>CPU</th>
            <td>3.5 GHz Quad-Core (64-bit)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>RAM</th>
            <td>4 GB</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Browser Support</h3>
        <p>The HTML5 build of E.X.O. is intended to be played in a recent version of a Chromium-based browser, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera. Browser extensions that alter page behavior are not recommended. Other browsers must support modern JavaScript features and the current Web Audio API specification.</p>

        <h3>Troubleshooting Performance Issues</h3>
        <p>E.X.O. has been optimized for its recommended system requirements. Pilots experiencing performance issues are encouraged to adjust settings on the <strong>Audio</strong> or <strong>Graphics</strong> screens. Audio stuttering can be solved by disabling reverb or reducing the number of objects. Frame rates can be improved by reducing draw distance or disabling graphics entirely.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>The E.X.O. is a versatile exosuit capable of traversing the most extreme terrain in the galaxy. It can transform seamlessly between bipedal and wheeled modes to handle unique demands. Equipped with jump jets, it can take short controlled flights through most atmospheres.</p>
        <p>This model is also equipped with a printer that can synthesize raw materials into spare parts. Conveniently, this world is littered with free elements. Collect and synthesize them to customize your exosuit. A fully upgraded exosuit can overcome any obstacle.</p>

        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>In bipedal mode, the E.X.O. grants pilots full freedom of movement, with forward, reverse, turning, and strafing controls. Pilots can jump or bunny hop continuously by holding the jump control. Jump jets can be activated by releasing and then holding the jump control while mid-jump.</p>
        <p>Pressing the <strong>Transform</strong> control toggles its mode. In wheeled mode, the E.X.O. gains a substantial speed boost at the expense of some freedoms, surrendering its ability to strafe and jump. Pressing and holding the jump control will immediately activate jump jets in this mode.</p>
        <p>With certain upgrades, the E.X.O. gains new abilities. For example, with the Vectors upgrade, pilots can direct their jump jets in any lateral direction by holding the forward, reverse, or strafing controls. Similarly, with the RCS Thrusters upgrade, they may turn mid-flight with the turning controls.</p>

        <h3>Terrain Sonification</h3>
        <p>Much of the surrounding terrain is obscured by bright ice and fog. By pressing the <strong>Sonify Terrain</strong> control, pilots can visualize local elevation differences with pitch. During the scan, the passage of time is paused so pilots can plot their next moves.</p>
        <p>Importantly, its results are communicated as streams of tones that extend outward from pilots to a 100-meter semicircle ahead of them. Level terrain is carefully tuned to Middle C, with each octave corresponding to 100 meters in either vertical direction. Nearby materials will be represented by brighter pings.</p>

        <h3>Materials</h3>
        <p>Materials are collectible objects which spawn in clusters throughout the world. They are grouped into four categories with unique sounds and uses. To collect them, pilots must get close and have available space. Pilots can collect adjacent materials with the Attractors upgrade.</p>
        <p>Pilots can inspect their inventory from the <strong>Materials</strong> screen. Each material type has a maximum capacity independent from one another. Pilots can increase their material capacity with the Cargo Racks upgrade.</p>

        <h3>Synthesis</h3>
        <p>Pilots are alerted whenever they have enough materials to synthesize a new upgrade for their exosuits. From the <strong>Synthesis</strong> screen, pilots can browse available upgrades, view their costs, and spend materials to synthesize them.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, pilots may want to downgrade their exosuit to an earlier state. A portion of the upgrade cost is recouped when downgrading the exosuit.</p>
        <p>Eventually, pilots will synthesize all upgrades and exhaust all uses for materials. With the Recycler upgrade, excess materials will be vaporized for temporal storage. Perhaps this may become useful later.</p>

        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>The E.X.O. supports a variety of input devices. Although remapping of controls is currently not available, alternate control schemes have been provided where appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Keyboard Controls</h3>
        <p>The E.X.O.’s keyboard controls support play with one or both hands:</p>

        <h3>Gamepad Controls</h3>
        <p>The E.X.O. supports standard gamepads such as an Xbox controller.

        <h4>Haptic Feedback</h4>
        <p>Feel the ice as the E.X.O. interrogates its surfaces. Vibration can be reduced or disabled entirely from the <strong>Controls</strong> screen.</p>

        <h3>Touch Controls</h3>
        <p>E.X.O. does not currently support touch beyond its menus. For best results on mobile devices, a gamepad is strongly recommended.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>E.X.O. is developed in accordance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 at Level AA conformance. Its menus are fully operable with a keyboard and screen readers such as NVDA.</p>

        <h3>Photosensitivity Warning</h3>
        <p>The E.X.O. can produce certain strobing patterns when moving at high velocities. Please navigate to the <strong>Graphics</strong> screen to make adjustments or disable them entirely.</p>

        <h3>Graphical Description</h3>
        <p>The bright white light reflecting off the ice and fog makes it difficult to see. Overhead, the colossal silhouette of the primary gas giant hangs tidally locked in the east. The E.X.O. visually reconstructs nearby terrain as a grid of equally-spaced black points on your heads-up-display. They suggest a relatively young surface with recent geological activity.</p>
